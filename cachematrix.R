## This program has a  pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## functions makeCacheMatrix helps to cache its inverse and cacheSolve will help in retrieving
## the inverse from the cache

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) { 
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) m <<-inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ## Computes inverse of matrix returned from above function makeCacheMatrix()
        ## and retrives from cache if already calculated.
 
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if ( ! is.null(m)) {
    print("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  m <- solve(x$get())
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
        
}
